# Next.js Router.push() Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `router.push()` method in Next.js applications, particularly when navigating between pages. The navigation might not work correctly or might cause unexpected behavior like page flickering or incomplete rendering.  This issue is often subtle and difficult to debug.

## Bug Description

The provided code includes two pages: `index.js` and `about.js`.  Navigating from `index.js` to `about.js` works fine. However, the button click within `about.js` which uses `router.push('/')` to return to the home page exhibits unexpected behavior. The navigation might fail or show incomplete rendering.

## Solution

The solution typically involves making sure that the data fetching or rendering logic is handled correctly within the pages, or that the navigation is optimized for smoother transitions in Next.js.
